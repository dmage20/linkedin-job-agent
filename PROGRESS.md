## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the project directory
2. **Configure credentials**: Create `.env` file with LinkedIn credentials
3. **Set up profile**: Create `user-profile.json` from the example template
4. **Add resume**: Copy resume.pdf to documents/ folder
5. **Test application**: Run on a real LinkedIn Easy Apply job

### After Initial Testing
1. Debug and fix any issues found during testing
2. Optimize form field selectors for better detection
3. Add more robust error handling
4. Improve logging and feedback messages

### Phase 2 Preparation
1. Set up Claude API integration
2. Design cover letter generation prompt templates
3. Build job description analyzer
4. Create skills matching algorithm

## Blockers / Open Questions

### Resolved
- ✅ **Credential Storage:** Using .env file (gitignored) - IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ **2FA Handling:** Agent pauses and waits for manual completion - IMPLEMENTED
- ✅ **Rate Limiting:** Human-like delays added throughout - IMPLEMENTED

### Active
- **Real-world Testing Needed:** Phase 1 code is complete but untested on actual LinkedIn
- **Form Selector Accuracy:** May need adjustments based on current LinkedIn DOM structure
- **Edge Cases:** Need to handle various application form variations

### Future Considerations
- **CAPTCHA Frequency:** Monitor how often LinkedIn shows CAPTCHAs
- **Account Safety:** Determine safe application rate limits
- **Session Persistence:** Consider saving browser sessions to avoid repeated logins

---

## Technical Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **Language:** Node.js (JavaScript)
- **Browser Automation:** Playwright (via MCP tools available in Claude Code)
- **AI/LLM:** Claude API (for Phase 2)
- **Database:** SQLite (for Phase 3 - application tracking)
- **Config Format:** JSON
