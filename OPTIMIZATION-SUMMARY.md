# Agent Optimization Summary

## First Successful Run Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Job:** Full Stack Engineer at Tasty
**Result:** ‚úÖ Successfully submitted application

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Iterations | 18 |
| Wasted Iterations | 3 (scrolling blindly) |
| Successful Submission | Yes |
| Form Fields Filled | All (phone, email, resume, custom questions) |
| User Confirmation | Yes |
| Token Usage | Under rate limit ‚úÖ |

## Iteration Breakdown

### Phase 1: Navigation & Discovery (Iterations 1-6)
```
1. ‚úÖ Navigate to job URL
2. ‚ùå Scroll down (unnecessary - should have taken snapshot first)
3. ‚ùå Scroll down (unnecessary)
4. ‚ùå Scroll up (unnecessary - undoing previous scrolls)
5. ‚úÖ Take snapshot (SHOULD HAVE BEEN ITERATION 2!)
6. ‚úÖ Click Easy Apply button
```

**Optimization:** Skip iterations 2-4 by taking snapshot immediately after navigation.

### Phase 2: Modal Form (Iterations 7-9)
```
7. ‚úÖ Wait for modal
8. ‚úÖ Take snapshot (modal detection worked!)
9. ‚úÖ Click Next (pre-filled fields detected)
```

**Performance:** Excellent - modal detection working perfectly.

### Phase 3: Resume Upload (Iteration 10)
```
10. ‚úÖ Click Next (resume already uploaded)
```

**Performance:** Great - recognized pre-existing resume.

### Phase 4: Custom Questions (Iterations 11-14)
```
11. ‚úÖ Type "3" (Next.js experience)
12. ‚úÖ Type "6" (Coding experience)
13. ‚úÖ Select "Yes" (coding before school)
14. ‚úÖ Click Review
```

**Performance:** Excellent - all fields filled correctly.

### Phase 5: Review & Submit (Iterations 15-18)
```
15. ‚úÖ Click Review
16. ‚úÖ User confirmation ‚Üí Submit
17. ‚úÖ Dismiss loading dialog
18. ‚úÖ Task complete
```

**Performance:** Perfect - asked for confirmation before submitting.

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. **System Prompt Update** ‚úÖ
**Before:**
```
1. Navigate to URL
2. Take snapshot
3. Click button
```

**After:**
```
1. Navigate to URL
2. **IMMEDIATELY take snapshot (DO NOT scroll first!)**
3. Find button in snapshot and click
```

**Impact:** Should eliminate 3 wasted iterations (16% efficiency gain).

### 2. **Modal Detection** ‚úÖ (Already Implemented)
- Automatically detects modal/dialog popups
- Extracts modal content from end of DOM
- Shows Claude only the relevant modal content

**Impact:** Critical for form filling to work.

### 3. **Token Optimization** ‚úÖ (Already Implemented)
- Snapshot truncation: 58k ‚Üí 15k chars
- Profile compression: Full profile ‚Üí Key fields only
- History limiting: All messages ‚Üí Last 10 only
- Max tokens reduced: 4096 ‚Üí 2048

**Impact:** 77% token reduction, staying under rate limits.

## Expected Performance After Optimization

### Before Optimization
```
Total Iterations: 18
- Navigation: 1
- Wasted scrolling: 3  ‚Üê ELIMINATED
- Discovery: 1
- Modal handling: 2
- Form filling: 7
- Review & submit: 4
```

### After Optimization
```
Total Iterations: 15 (17% faster)
- Navigation: 1
- Discovery: 1  ‚Üê Immediate snapshot
- Modal handling: 2
- Form filling: 7
- Review & submit: 4
```

## Key Learnings

### What Worked Well ‚úÖ
1. **MCP Server Integration** - Refs are precise and reliable
2. **Modal Detection** - Automatically prioritizes popup content
3. **Pre-filled Field Detection** - Claude recognized existing values
4. **Multi-step Form Handling** - Navigated through steps correctly
5. **User Confirmation** - Paused before submission as required

### What Was Inefficient ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Blind Scrolling** - Claude scrolled without taking snapshot first
2. **Multiple Scrolls** - Scrolled down twice then undid it

### Fixes Applied üîß
1. **Updated system prompt** - Emphasize "snapshot BEFORE scroll"
2. **Added explicit workflow** - Step-by-step instructions
3. **Added warning** - "DO NOT scroll blindly"

## Token Usage Analysis

### Per Iteration (Estimated)
- System prompt: ~800 tokens
- User profile (condensed): ~200 tokens
- Snapshot (truncated): ~4,000 tokens
- Conversation history (last 10): ~2,000 tokens
- Output: ~500 tokens

**Total per iteration:** ~7,500 tokens

### Rate Limit Compliance
- Rate limit: 20,000 tokens/minute
- Can handle: ~2.5 iterations/minute
- 18 iterations took: ~7-8 minutes
- **Status:** Well under limit ‚úÖ

## Recommendations for Future Runs

### Immediate
1. ‚úÖ Test optimized prompt on another job posting
2. Monitor if blind scrolling is eliminated
3. Measure new iteration count

### Future Enhancements
1. **Caching** - Cache common page patterns to reduce snapshot size
2. **Smarter Truncation** - Use AI to identify most relevant content
3. **Parallel Actions** - Fill multiple fields in one iteration
4. **Learning** - Remember which fields LinkedIn commonly asks

## Cost Estimate

### Current Run
- Input tokens: ~135,000 (18 iterations √ó 7,500 avg)
- Output tokens: ~9,000 (18 iterations √ó 500 avg)
- Cost: ~$0.45 per application

### After Optimization (15 iterations)
- Input tokens: ~112,500
- Output tokens: ~7,500
- Cost: ~$0.37 per application
- **Savings:** 18% cost reduction

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Actual | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Application submitted | Yes | Yes | ‚úÖ |
| All fields filled | Yes | Yes | ‚úÖ |
| User confirmation | Yes | Yes | ‚úÖ |
| Under rate limit | Yes | Yes | ‚úÖ |
| Under $1 cost | Yes | ~$0.45 | ‚úÖ |
| Under 30 iterations | Yes | 18 | ‚úÖ |
