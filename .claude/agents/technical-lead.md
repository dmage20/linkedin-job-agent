- Minimize side effects

Error Handling:
- Explicit error handling
- Meaningful error messages
- Proper logging and monitoring
- Graceful degradation strategies
```

### Review Process
```
Pull Request Requirements:
1. All tests passing
2. Code coverage maintained or improved
3. Self-documenting code or appropriate comments
4. No compiler warnings or linter issues
5. Performance impact assessed
6. Security implications considered
