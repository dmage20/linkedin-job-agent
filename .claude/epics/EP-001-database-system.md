# Epic: Database System for Job Management

**Epic ID**: EP-001
**Theme**: Data Management Foundation
**Product Owner**: Claude Product Owner
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: PLANNING

## Business Objective

Enable persistent storage and management of job data to support automated job application tracking, eliminate duplicate applications, and provide foundation for all future job agent functionality.

## Problem Statement

The LinkedIn Job Agent currently lacks a persistent storage mechanism for job data, resulting in:
- Loss of job discovery history between sessions
- Inability to track application status and prevent duplicates
- No historical data for analytics and optimization
- Manual tracking overhead for users

## Epic Description

Implement a comprehensive database system using SQLAlchemy and SQLite that provides:
1. Structured storage of job posting data
2. Application status tracking throughout the hiring process
3. Intelligent duplicate detection and prevention
4. Flexible search and filtering capabilities

## Business Value

- **Efficiency**: Reduce manual tracking overhead by 90%
- **Quality**: Eliminate duplicate applications through automation
- **Intelligence**: Enable data-driven application strategies
- **Scalability**: Support processing 1000+ job postings daily
- **Compliance**: Maintain complete audit trail

## Success Metrics

- Database handles 1000+ jobs with <100ms query response
- 99.5% duplicate detection accuracy
- Zero duplicate applications post-implementation
- 100% data persistence with backup/recovery

## User Stories

### US-001: Job Data Storage (HIGH)
**As a** LinkedIn Job Agent
**I want** to store job posting data in a structured database
**So that** I can maintain persistent records of all job opportunities

**Key Features:**
- SQLAlchemy ORM models with proper relationships
- Essential job fields (title, company, location, description, URL, salary, dates)
- CRUD operations and database migrations
- Automatic SQLite database creation

### US-002: Application Status Tracking (HIGH)
**As a** LinkedIn Job Agent
**I want** to track application status for each job
**So that** I can monitor progress and avoid duplicate applications

**Key Features:**
- Application lifecycle tracking (NOT_APPLIED → APPLIED → INTERVIEWING → etc.)
- One-to-many Job-Application relationship
- Timestamp tracking for status changes
- Programmatic status updates

### US-003: Duplicate Job Detection (HIGH)
**As a** LinkedIn Job Agent
**I want** to detect and handle duplicate job postings
**So that** I don't waste effort on previously seen jobs

**Key Features:**
- URL-based primary duplicate detection
- Fuzzy matching on company+title+location
- Configurable similarity thresholds
- Merge functionality for near-duplicates

### US-004: Job Search and Filtering (MEDIUM)
**As a** LinkedIn Job Agent
**I want** to search and filter stored job data
**So that** I can find relevant opportunities and analyze trends

**Key Features:**
- Keyword search across title, company, description
- Multi-criteria filtering (location, salary, date, status)
- Result sorting and pagination
- Export to CSV/JSON

## Dependencies

**External:**
- SQLAlchemy 2.0.23 ✓ (in requirements.txt)
- Python 3.8+ for modern SQLAlchemy features
- SQLite driver (included with Python)

**Internal:**
- `/src/database/` module structure exists ✓
- Configuration system for database settings
- Logging framework for monitoring

**Story Dependencies:**
- US-002, US-003, US-004 depend on US-001
- US-003 benefits from US-002 for status-aware duplicate logic
- US-004 leverages all previous stories for comprehensive filtering

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Data Migration**: Schema changes during development
   - *Mitigation*: Implement Alembic versioning from start
2. **Performance**: Large datasets affecting query speed
   - *Mitigation*: Proper indexing and query optimization
3. **Concurrency**: Multiple agent instances causing locks
   - *Mitigation*: Connection pooling and transaction management
4. **Data Loss**: Corruption or accidental deletion
   - *Mitigation*: Automated backup strategy

### Business Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Requests for advanced analytics
   - *Mitigation*: Clear boundaries and future roadmap
2. **Timeline**: Design complexity delaying other features
   - *Mitigation*: MVP approach with essential fields first

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```
Jobs Table:
- id (Primary Key)
- title, company, location
- description, requirements
- url (Unique), salary_range
- posted_date, scraped_date
- created_at, updated_at

Applications Table:
- id (Primary Key)
- job_id (Foreign Key)
- status (Enum)
- applied_date, response_date
- notes, created_at, updated_at
```

### Technology Stack
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 with declarative base
- **Database**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL production-ready
- **Migrations**: Alembic for schema versioning
- **Testing**: pytest with database fixtures

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All user stories meet acceptance criteria
- [ ] Unit test coverage >95% for database operations
- [ ] Integration tests with real SQLite database
- [ ] Performance tests with 1000+ job records
- [ ] Code review by Technical Lead
- [ ] Documentation for database schema and API
- [ ] Migration scripts tested
- [ ] Backup/restore procedures documented

## Future Considerations

**Post-Epic Enhancements:**
- Advanced search with Elasticsearch
- Data analytics and reporting dashboard
- Job recommendation engine based on stored preferences
- Integration with external job boards beyond LinkedIn
- Real-time notifications for status changes
