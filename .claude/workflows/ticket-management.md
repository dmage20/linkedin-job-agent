# Ticket Management System

## Ticket Types and Workflow

### User Story (US)
**Format**: US-[NUMBER]
**Purpose**: Feature development with business value

**Workflow**: Backlog → Ready → In Progress → Code Review → Testing → Done

**States**:
- **Backlog**: Initial state, needs refinement
- **Ready**: Acceptance criteria defined, ready for sprint
- **In Progress**: Development started
- **Code Review**: Implementation complete, under review
- **Testing**: QA validation in progress
- **Done**: Accepted by Product Owner

### Bug (BUG)
**Format**: BUG-[NUMBER]
**Purpose**: Defect resolution

**Workflow**: Reported → Triaged → In Progress → Fixed → Verified → Closed

**Priority Levels**:
- **Critical**: System down, data loss
- **High**: Major feature broken
- **Medium**: Minor feature issue
- **Low**: Cosmetic or edge case

### Technical Task (TECH)
**Format**: TECH-[NUMBER]
**Purpose**: Technical improvement without direct user value

**Workflow**: Proposed → Approved → In Progress → Review → Complete

### Spike (SPIKE)
**Format**: SPIKE-[NUMBER]
**Purpose**: Research and investigation

**Workflow**: Proposed → Investigating → Findings Documented → Complete

## Ticket Status Definitions

### Backlog Management

#### Backlog Refinement Process
1. **Product Owner** creates initial user story
2. **Technical Lead** adds technical notes and dependencies
3. **QA/Tester** reviews for testability
4. **Scrum Master** facilitates team estimation
5. **Developer** provides effort estimate

#### Ready Criteria
- [ ] User story follows standard format
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are clear and testable
- [ ] Technical approach discussed
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Story points estimated
- [ ] Priority assigned

### In-Progress Management

#### Development Workflow
1. **Developer** moves ticket to "In Progress"
2. Creates feature branch following naming convention
3. Implements with TDD approach (Red-Green-Refactor)
4. Updates ticket with progress notes
5. Moves to "Code Review" when implementation complete

#### Code Review Process
1. **Developer** creates pull request
2. **Technical Lead** conducts code review
3. **QA/Tester** reviews test coverage
4. Feedback addressed and approved
5. Code merged to main branch

#### Testing Process
1. **QA/Tester** moves ticket to "Testing"
2. Validates against acceptance criteria
3. Performs regression testing
4. Reports any issues found
5. Moves to "Done" when all tests pass

## Sprint Board Layout

### Columns
1. **Backlog** - Stories ready for future sprints
2. **Sprint Backlog** - Committed stories for current sprint
3. **In Progress** - Active development
4. **Code Review** - Implementation complete, under review
5. **Testing** - QA validation
6. **Done** - Completed and accepted

### Swim Lanes (by Agent)
- **Product Owner**: Requirements and acceptance
- **Developer**: Implementation tasks
- **QA/Tester**: Testing and validation tasks
- **Technical Lead**: Architecture and review tasks
- **DevOps**: Infrastructure and deployment tasks
- **Scrum Master**: Process and facilitation tasks

## Ticket Assignment Rules

### Automatic Assignments
- **User Stories**: Initially assigned to Product Owner for criteria definition
- **Code Reviews**: Automatically assigned to Technical Lead
- **Testing**: Automatically assigned to QA/Tester
- **Deployment**: Automatically assigned to DevOps

### Collaborative Assignments
- **Implementation**: Developer takes ownership during sprint planning
- **Spike Research**: Assigned to most appropriate team member
- **Bug Fixes**: Assigned based on component expertise

## Progress Tracking

### Daily Standup Updates
Each agent reports on their tickets:
```
Agent: [AGENT_NAME]
Yesterday: Completed [TICKET_IDS], progressed [TICKET_IDS]
Today: Working on [TICKET_IDS]
Blockers: [BLOCKING_TICKETS] blocked by [REASON]
```

### Sprint Burndown
Track remaining story points daily:
- **Day 1**: [TOTAL_POINTS] committed
- **Day 2**: [REMAINING_POINTS] remaining
- **Day 3**: [REMAINING_POINTS] remaining
- ...
- **Day 10**: [REMAINING_POINTS] remaining

### Velocity Tracking
- **Sprint 1**: [COMPLETED_POINTS] points
- **Sprint 2**: [COMPLETED_POINTS] points
- **Sprint 3**: [COMPLETED_POINTS] points
- **Average Velocity**: [AVERAGE_POINTS] points

## Escalation Procedures

### Blocked Tickets
1. **Assignee** identifies blocker and updates ticket
2. **Scrum Master** triages blocker severity
3. **Appropriate Agent** assigned to resolve blocker
4. Daily standup tracks blocker resolution
5. **Scrum Master** escalates if not resolved within 2 days

### Scope Changes
1. **Product Owner** proposes change to existing ticket
2. **Technical Lead** assesses technical impact
3. **Scrum Master** evaluates sprint impact
4. **Team** decides: accept change or create new ticket

### Quality Issues
1. **QA/Tester** identifies acceptance criteria not met
2. Ticket returned to **Developer** with specific feedback
3. **Technical Lead** consulted if architectural change needed
4. **Product Owner** clarifies requirements if criteria ambiguous

## Reporting and Metrics

### Sprint Reports
Generated automatically at sprint end:
- Committed vs completed story points
- Cycle time per ticket type
- Defect rate and resolution time
