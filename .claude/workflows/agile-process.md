# Agile Development Workflow

## Overview

This document defines the Agile workflow for our development team, incorporating Test-Driven Development (TDD) and incremental delivery practices.

## Sprint Cycle (2-week iterations)

### Week 1

#### Day 1: Sprint Planning
**Duration**: 2-4 hours
**Participants**: Entire team
**Facilitator**: Scrum Master

**Process**:
1. **Product Owner** presents prioritized backlog items
2. **Technical Lead** provides architectural context and constraints
3. **Developer** and **QA/Tester** estimate effort for each story
4. **Team** commits to sprint goal and selected stories
5. **DevOps** identifies infrastructure/deployment needs

**Outputs**:
- Sprint goal defined
- Stories committed with acceptance criteria
- Technical approach agreed upon
- Sprint backlog created

#### Days 2-5: Development Sprint (First Half)
**Daily Standup** (15 minutes):
- Each agent reports: completed yesterday, plan for today, blockers
- **Scrum Master** tracks progress and removes impediments

**Development Process**:
1. **Developer** starts with failing tests (TDD Red phase)
2. **QA/Tester** reviews test coverage and creates additional test plans
3. **Technical Lead** provides code review and architectural guidance
4. **DevOps** prepares deployment infrastructure

#### Day 5: Mid-Sprint Check-in
- **Scrum Master** facilitates progress review
- Adjust sprint scope if needed
- Address any major blockers

### Week 2

#### Days 6-9: Development Sprint (Second Half)
- Continue TDD Green and Refactor phases
- **QA/Tester** performs integration and system testing
- **DevOps** prepares staging deployment
- **Product Owner** reviews completed features

#### Day 10: Sprint Review & Retrospective

**Sprint Review** (1-2 hours):
1. **Product Owner** facilitates demo of completed features
2. **Developer** demonstrates working software
3. **QA/Tester** presents quality metrics
4. **DevOps** reports on deployment readiness
5. Stakeholder feedback collection

**Sprint Retrospective** (1 hour):
1. **Scrum Master** facilitates team reflection
2. What went well?
3. What could be improved?
4. Action items for next sprint

## Test-Driven Development Integration

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

#### Red Phase (Write Failing Test)
- **QA/Tester** collaborates with **Developer** on test scenarios
- **Developer** writes minimal failing test
- **Technical Lead** reviews test design and approach

#### Green Phase (Make Test Pass)
- **Developer** implements minimal code to pass test
- **Technical Lead** provides guidance on implementation approach
- **QA/Tester** validates test behavior

#### Refactor Phase (Clean Up Code)
- **Developer** improves code while maintaining test coverage
- **Technical Lead** conducts code review
- **DevOps** ensures deployment readiness

## Incremental Delivery Process

### Feature Slicing Strategy

#### Vertical Slices
Break features into thin vertical slices that deliver end-to-end value:

**Example: User Authentication Feature**
1. **Slice 1**: Basic login with hardcoded credentials (demonstrable)
2. **Slice 2**: Database user lookup (testable)
3. **Slice 3**: Password encryption (reviewable)
4. **Slice 4**: Session management (approvable)

#### Acceptance Criteria per Slice
Each slice must have:
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Testable functionality
- Demonstrable value
- Path to production deployment

### Review and Approval Workflow

#### 1. Development Complete
**Developer** marks story as "Ready for Review"
- All tests passing
- Code reviewed by **Technical Lead**
- Feature deployed to development environment

#### 2. QA Validation
**QA/Tester** validates against acceptance criteria
- Functional testing complete
- Regression tests passing
- Performance within acceptable limits

#### 3. Product Owner Review
**Product Owner** reviews feature for business value
- Acceptance criteria satisfied
- User experience meets expectations
- Ready for stakeholder demo

#### 4. Stakeholder Approval
Feature demonstrated to stakeholder
- Feedback collected and documented
- Approval given or change requests noted
- Next increment planned

#### 5. Production Deployment
**DevOps** deploys approved feature
- Zero-downtime deployment
- Monitoring and alerting active
- Rollback plan ready

## Change Management Process

### Handling Change Requests

#### During Sprint
1. **Product Owner** evaluates change impact
2. **Scrum Master** assesses effect on sprint commitment
3. **Technical Lead** estimates technical effort
4. **Team** decides: accept (with scope adjustment) or defer to next sprint

#### Change Request Template
```
Change Request: [TITLE]
Requestor: [STAKEHOLDER]
Business Justification: [WHY_NEEDED]
Current Story Impact: [AFFECTED_STORIES]
Effort Estimate: [HOURS/STORY_POINTS]
Priority: [HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW]
Proposed Solution: [APPROACH]
```

### Context Preservation

#### Story Evolution Tracking
Maintain history of requirement changes:
- Original acceptance criteria
- Change requests and rationale
- Updated acceptance criteria
- Impact on related stories

#### Decision Log
Document key decisions made during development:
- Technical approach decisions
- Scope adjustments
- Trade-off decisions
- Architectural choices

## Quality Gates

### Definition of Ready (Before Sprint)
Stories must have:
- [ ] Clear user story format
- [ ] Detailed acceptance criteria
- [ ] Technical approach discussed
- [ ] Dependencies identified
- [ ] Effort estimated
- [ ] Test strategy defined

### Definition of Done (Sprint Completion)
Features must have:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests passing (>95% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] QA testing complete
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Deployed to staging environment
- [ ] Product Owner acceptance

## Communication Protocols

### Daily Communication
- **Daily Standup**: Progress, plans, blockers
- **Ad-hoc Collaboration**: Pairing, reviews, discussions
- **Slack/Teams**: Async updates and questions

### Sprint Communication
- **Sprint Planning**: Commitment and technical approach
