## Retrospective Items to Discuss
- Estimation accuracy for Playwright setup
- Database design decisions
- Team collaboration effectiveness
- Tool setup challenges

## Technical Decisions Made
- **ADR-001**: Use SQLAlchemy with SQLite for initial development
  - Rationale: Simple setup, can migrate to PostgreSQL later
- **ADR-002**: Use Playwright over Selenium
  - Rationale: Better reliability and modern browser support
- **ADR-003**: Implement rate limiting from start
  - Rationale: Avoid LinkedIn blocking early in development
